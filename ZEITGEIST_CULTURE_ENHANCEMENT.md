# üåç Zeitgeist & Culture Enhancement for 10Q Database

## Overview

This enhancement adds comprehensive zeitgeist and cultural awareness requirements to the question generation system, helping it tap into current cultural conversations, popular opinions, and Reddit-style knowledge that reflects how people actually think and talk about topics.

## What Was Added

### 1. **New Zeitgeist & Culture Template** (`src/prompts/templates/shared/zeitgeist-culture.ts`)

**Primary Template Features:**
- **Cultural Awareness**: References to current popular opinions and cultural conversations
- **Reddit-Style Knowledge**: What people actually discuss, debate, and find interesting
- **Popular Opinions**: Widely-held but rarely-stated opinions about topics
- **Cultural Pulse**: Current cultural touchstones and shared references
- **Hot Takes**: Controversial but common opinions that people actually discuss
- **Cultural Discourse**: Language and perspectives that reflect current cultural conversations

**Key Requirements:**
- Include references to current popular opinions and cultural conversations
- Use knowledge that reflects how people actually think and talk about topics
- Incorporate "Reddit-style" knowledge - what people discuss, debate, and find interesting
- Include "hot takes" and popular opinions that people actually hold
- Reference current cultural touchstones and shared experiences
- Use language and perspectives that reflect current cultural discourse

### 2. **Integration with Existing System**

**Updated Components:**
- **Base Template**: Added zeitgeist and culture section to question generation
- **Prompt Builder**: Integrated zeitgeist and culture template injection
- **Fallback System**: Simplified zeitgeist and culture for reduced complexity
- **Export System**: Added zeitgeist and culture utilities to main exports

**Template Injection:**
```typescript
// Now includes zeitgeist and culture requirements
{zeitgeist_culture}
```

### 3. **Validation Functions**

**New Validation Capabilities:**
- `checkZeitgeistCulture()`: Analyzes clues for cultural awareness and zeitgeist relevance
- `validateZeitgeistCulture()`: Topic-specific cultural validation
- `getZeitgeistCultureGuidelines()`: Returns best practices for cultural content

**Detection Features:**
- Cultural awareness elements ("often called", "popularly known as", "widely considered")
- Current debates and discussions ("controversial", "debated", "hot take")
- Reddit-style assessments ("underrated", "overrated", "underappreciated")
- "Actually..." facts that correct misconceptions
- Current digital culture references ("Reddit", "social media", "online")
- Generational touchstones ("millennial", "Gen Z", "boomer")

## Effects on Question Generation

```

### **After Enhancement**
```
‚úÖ Example: "This movie is often called 'overrated' on Reddit, but it actually won Best Picture in 1994."
‚úÖ Example: "This programming language is constantly debated on tech forums - some call it 'elegant' while others say it's 'overcomplicated'."
