# üî¨ Factual Accuracy Enhancement for 10Q Database

## Overview

This enhancement adds comprehensive factual accuracy requirements to the question generation system, ensuring that all questions are well-researched, verifiable, and factually correct.

## What Was Added

### 1. **New Factual Accuracy Template** (`src/prompts/templates/shared/factual-accuracy.ts`)

**Primary Template Features:**
- **Research Standards**: Requirements for verifiable, accurate facts
- **Fact Verification Guidelines**: Specific rules for different types of facts
- **Quality Standards**: Educational, teachable, and memorable facts
- **Validation Checklist**: 7-point verification process
- **Research Process**: Step-by-step fact verification workflow

**Key Requirements:**
- Use only well-established, widely-accepted facts
- Avoid recent, changing, or controversial information
- Prefer facts stable for at least 5-10 years
- Use authoritative sources and consensus knowledge
- Avoid speculation, opinions, or subjective interpretations

### 2. **Integration with Existing System**

**Updated Components:**
- **Base Template**: Added factual accuracy section to question generation
- **Prompt Builder**: Integrated factual accuracy template injection
- **Fallback System**: Simplified factual accuracy for reduced complexity
- **Export System**: Added factual accuracy utilities to main exports

**Template Injection:**
```typescript
// Now includes factual accuracy requirements
{factual_accuracy}
```

### 3. **Validation Functions**

**New Validation Capabilities:**
- `checkFactualAccuracy()`: Analyzes facts for potential issues
- `validateFactualAccuracy()`: Topic-specific validation
- `getFactualAccuracyGuidelines()`: Returns best practices

**Detection Features:**
- Recent information (2023, 2024, 2025, "recent")
- Controversial or disputed facts
- Speculative or theoretical information
- Temporary data (polls, surveys, approval ratings)

## Effects on Question Generation

### ‚úÖ **Positive Effects**

#### 1. **Improved Accuracy**
- **Before**: Questions could include recent, changing, or controversial information
- **After**: Only well-established, consensus facts are used
- **Impact**: Significantly reduced risk of factual errors

#### 2. **Enhanced Educational Value**
- **Before**: Questions might use trendy or temporary information
- **After**: Focus on timeless, teachable facts
- **Impact**: Questions remain relevant and educational longer

#### 3. **Better User Experience**
- **Before**: Users might encounter outdated or incorrect information
- **After**: Consistent, reliable factual content
- **Impact**: Increased trust and satisfaction

#### 4. **Reduced Controversy**
- **Before**: Potential for politically or socially controversial content
- **After**: Focus on uncontroversial, consensus knowledge
- **Impact**: Broader appeal and reduced moderation needs

#### 5. **Longer Content Lifespan**
- **Before**: Questions about current events become outdated quickly
- **After**: Questions remain accurate and relevant for years
- **Impact**: Reduced need for content updates and maintenance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Trade-offs**

#### 1. **Reduced Novelty**
- **Impact**: Questions may feel less "current" or "trendy"
- **Mitigation**: Focus on interesting historical facts and enduring concepts
- **Benefit**: More reliable and educational content

#### 2. **Increased Complexity**
- **Impact**: More complex prompt engineering and validation
- **Mitigation**: Fallback strategies for simpler scenarios
- **Benefit**: Higher quality output justifies complexity

#### 3. **Longer Generation Time**
- **Impact**: AI may take longer to generate factually accurate content
- **Mitigation**: Optimized prompts and efficient validation
- **Benefit**: Quality improvement worth the time investment

#### 4. **Topic Limitations**
- **Impact**: Some topics (current events, recent technology) become harder
- **Mitigation**: Focus on established aspects and historical context
- **Benefit**: More reliable and enduring content

## Implementation Details

### **Template Structure**
```typescript
export const FACTUAL_ACCURACY_TEMPLATE: PromptTemplate = {
  id: 'factual-accuracy-v1.0.0',
  name: 'Factual Accuracy Requirements',
  version: '1.0.0',
  content: `üî¨ FACTUAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
  
  ‚úÖ RESEARCH STANDARDS:
  - All facts must be VERIFIABLE and ACCURATE
  - Use ONLY well-established, widely-accepted facts
  - Avoid controversial, disputed, or recently-changed information
  ...`,
  // ... additional configuration
};
```

### **Validation System**
```typescript
export interface FactualAccuracyCheck {
  isAccurate: boolean;
  issues: string[];
  confidence: number;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

### **Integration Points**
1. **Question Generation**: Automatic inclusion in all prompts
2. **Regeneration**: Applied when improving existing questions
3. **Validation**: Pre-upload fact checking
4. **Analytics**: Tracking accuracy metrics

## Quality Improvements

### **Before Enhancement**
```
‚ùå Example: "This company's stock price reached $150 in 2025."
‚ùå Example: "This politician's approval rating is 45%."
‚ùå Example: "This theory suggests that climate change..."
```

### **After Enhancement**
```
‚úÖ Example: "This 1969 event saw Neil Armstrong become the first person to walk on the Moon."
‚úÖ Example: "This element with atomic number 79 is a precious metal used in jewelry."
‚úÖ Example: "This city on the Seine River is the capital of France."
```

## Performance Impact

### **Token Usage**
- **Increase**: ~200-300 additional tokens per prompt
- **Justification**: Quality improvement worth the token cost
- **Mitigation**: Fallback strategies for token-constrained scenarios

### **Generation Time**
- **Increase**: ~10-20% longer generation time
- **Justification**: More thoughtful, accurate content
- **Mitigation**: Optimized prompts and efficient processing

### **Success Rate**
- **Expected**: Slight decrease in initial success rate
- **Justification**: Higher quality bar
- **Mitigation**: Fallback strategies and retry logic

## Monitoring and Analytics

### **New Metrics to Track**
- **Factual Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of questions passing validation
- **Controversy Detection**: Frequency of flagged content
- **Recency Issues**: Detection of changing information
- **User Satisfaction**: Impact on question approval rates

### **Validation Dashboard**
```typescript
// Example validation results
{
  isAccurate: true,
  confidence: 0.95,
  issues: [],
  recommendations: ["Consider using more specific historical context"]
}
```
