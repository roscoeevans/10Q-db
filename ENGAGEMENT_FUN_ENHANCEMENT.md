‚ùå Example: "This element has atomic number 79."
‚ùå Example: "This artist painted the Mona Lisa."
```

### **After Enhancement**
```
‚úÖ Example: "This city's name means 'City of the Dead' in Arabic, but it's actually one of the world's most vibrant living cities."
‚úÖ Example: "This element is so dense that a teaspoon of it would weigh as much as an elephant."
‚úÖ Example: "This artist cut off his own ear and sent it to a woman, but historians now think it was just the earlobe."
```
