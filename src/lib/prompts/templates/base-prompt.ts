Generate ${count} Jeopardy!-style clues for the topic: "${topic}"

üéØ CORE FORMAT:
- Write CLUES (statements), not questions
- Use "This [person/place/thing]..." format
- End with periods, never question marks
- Keep clues concise (10-20 words)
- Make clues engaging and fun, not dry

üö® CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
- Every fact must be 100% accurate
- Double-check dates, names, and details
- Avoid ambiguous or disputed information
- Use specific, verifiable facts
- When in doubt, choose the most widely accepted fact

‚úÖ CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "This city on the Seine is the capital of France." ‚Üí What is Paris?
- "This Norse god wields a hammer named Mjolnir." ‚Üí Who is Thor?
- "This 1969 event saw Neil Armstrong take one small step." ‚Üí What is the Moon landing?

‚ùå WRONG FORMAT (NEVER DO THIS):
- "What is the capital of France?" (WRONG - direct question)
- "This Paris is the capital of France." (WRONG - answer in clue)
- "This city is the capital of France." (WRONG - too vague)

üìà DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:
- Questions 1-2: EASY (general knowledge)
- Questions 3-5: INTERMEDIATE (specific facts)
- Questions 6-8: ADVANCED (detailed knowledge)
- Questions 9-10: EXPERT (specialist knowledge)

üè∑Ô∏è TAG STRUCTURE (3 tags per question):
- First: Broad category (History, Science, Pop Culture, etc.)
- Second: Sub-category (American History, Physics, TV Shows, etc.)
- Third: Specific detail (Presidential Elections, Newtonian Mechanics, 90s Sitcoms, etc.)

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanations.

EXACT JSON STRUCTURE REQUIRED:
[
  {
    "question": "This city on the Seine is the capital of France.",
    "choices": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Madrid"],
    "answer": "Paris",
    "tags": ["Geography", "Europe", "Capitals"]
  }
]

üö® JSON RULES:
- Use ONLY standard JSON syntax
- No special characters, no Unicode arrows (‚Üê), no formatting
- All strings must be in double quotes
- No trailing commas
- Correct answer must be FIRST in choices array
- Answer field must exactly match first choice
- All fields are required: question, choices, answer, tags
- Choices array must have exactly 4 items
- Tags array must have exactly 3 items

‚ùå COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Don't use Unicode arrows: ‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üì
- Don't use smart quotes: " " ' '
- Don't add markdown formatting: \`\`\`json or \`\`\`
- Don't add explanations before or after JSON
- Don't use bullet points or special characters
- Don't put answer in wrong position in choices array

‚úÖ CORRECT EXAMPLE:
[
  {
    "question": "This fashion accessory was popularized by Madonna in the 1980s.",
    "choices": ["Studded belt", "Choker", "Leg warmers", "Shoulder pads"],
    "answer": "Studded belt",
    "tags": ["Fashion", "1980s", "Pop Culture"]
  }
]

‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL REMINDER: Return ONLY the JSON array. Nothing else.
