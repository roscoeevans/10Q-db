  content: `üìà DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION (CRITICAL):

üéØ DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
- Question 1: EASY - General knowledge that most people would know
- Question 2-3: BEGINNER - Basic facts that casual fans might know  
- Question 4-6: INTERMEDIATE - Requires some knowledge of the topic
- Question 7-8: ADVANCED - For people well-versed in the subject
- Question 9: EXPERT - Very challenging, specialist knowledge
- Question 10: MASTER - Only true experts/enthusiasts would know this

üí° DIFFICULTY SCALING TIPS:
- EASY clues: Mainstream knowledge, famous facts, widely known information
- INTERMEDIATE clues: Specific details, dates, lesser-known but not obscure facts
- EXPERT clues: Deep trivia, technical details, historical minutiae, insider knowledge
- All wrong answers should be plausible for the difficulty level

üéØ DIFFICULTY EXAMPLES for "{topic}":
- Easy (Q1): "This city on the Seine is the capital of France." ‚Üí What is Paris?
- Intermediate (Q5): "This Norse god wields a hammer named Mjolnir." ‚Üí Who is Thor?
- Expert (Q10): "This 1969 comic issue introduced Bucky Barnes as the Winter Soldier." ‚Üí What is Captain America #110?

‚ö†Ô∏è DIFFICULTY REQUIREMENTS:
- DIFFICULTY MUST SCALE: Start easy, end expert
- Each question should be progressively more challenging
- Wrong answers should match the difficulty level
- Avoid sudden difficulty spikes or drops
- Maintain consistency within the topic area`,
