  content: `üéØ CORE FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:

üìù QUESTION FORMAT:
- Write CLUES, not questions - contestants respond with questions
- Start with factual statements, end with periods (never question marks)
- Use "This [person/place/thing]..." format for specificity
- Keep clues brief and punchy (10-20 words max)
- Include context hints, dates, or wordplay when possible
- Tone should be academic but playful, trivia-forward but not dry
- NEVER include the answer directly in the clue text
- Provide context clues that lead to the answer, but don't state it

üö® CRITICAL: NEVER USE QUESTION FORMAT
- ‚ùå WRONG: "What industry did Andrew Carnegie make his fortune in?"
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Who plays Iron Man in the Marvel movies?"
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Where is the capital of France located?"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Andrew Carnegie made his fortune in this industry."
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "This actor plays Iron Man in the Marvel movies."
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "This city on the Seine is the capital of France."

‚úÖ CORRECT JEOPARDY! FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "This steel magnate made his fortune in the late 19th century." ‚Üí Who is Andrew Carnegie?
- "This 1994 film features a bus that must stay above 50 miles per hour." ‚Üí What is Speed?
- "This Greek goddess of wisdom sprang fully grown from Zeus's head." ‚Üí Who is Athena?
- "This 1969 event saw Neil Armstrong take one small step for man." ‚Üí What is the Moon landing?

‚ùå WRONG EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):
- "This Blighted Minotaur is a Taken enemy in Destiny." ‚Üí What is Blighted Minotaur? (WRONG - answer in clue!)
- "This Steve Jobs founded Apple." ‚Üí Who is Steve Jobs? (WRONG - answer in clue!)
- "This Paris is the capital of France." ‚Üí What is Paris? (WRONG - answer in clue!)

üß† JEOPARDY! WRITING RULES:
‚úÖ DO:
- Start with "This [person/place/thing]..." or factual statements
- Use specific nouns, dates, or context clues
- Include wordplay, puns, or clever associations when possible
- Keep clues concise and fact-packed
- End with periods, never question marks
- Make the expected answer a specific noun phrase
- Use "this" to refer to the answer (e.g., "this industry", "this actor", "this city")

‚ùå DON'T:
- Ask direct questions ("What is...?", "Who is...?", "Where is...?")
- Use question words in the clue ("what", "who", "where", "when", "why", "how")
- Include the answer directly in the clue text
- Make clues too long or verbose
- Use subjective or opinion-based statements
- End with question marks
- Tell contestants how to answer (e.g., "what industry" tells them to say "What is...")
- Put the answer in the clue (e.g., "This Blighted Minotaur is a Taken enemy" - WRONG!)
- Use the answer as a descriptor in the clue

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- The correct answer must ALWAYS be the FIRST choice in the "choices" array (index 0)
- The "answer" field must EXACTLY match the first choice in the "choices" array
- Do not provide explanatory text or additional information as the answer - only use the exact text from the first choice
- Each clue must have exactly 4 multiple choice options
- Each clue must have exactly 3 tags
- Tags must be unique within each clue
- Tags must be descriptive but concise
- Tags must follow the hierarchy: broad ‚Üí subcategory ‚Üí specific

üö® FINAL REMINDER: Every clue must be a STATEMENT, never a question. Use "this" to refer to the answer, not question words like "what", "who", "where".`,
